### R-Precision ### 
# R-Precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents, R, is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query.
# For example, it there are 15 documents relevant to "red" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for "red" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant `r' turns that into a relevancy franction r/R = r/15
# Precision is equal to recall at the R-th position.
# Empirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.

# from: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval

# Summarizing: In order to calculate the R-Precision of a query, we have to perform it, grub the results, check how many doc_ids, r, of the first R are returned that are in the in the R doc_ids that we know a priori.
# In order to calculate the ``Average R-Precision'', I THINK, we have to do the average upon all the R-Precision calculated on all the Q queries:
# i.e. 1/Q * \sum_i{RP_i}
